# Grid-Problem
**Task:
Objective**
  Build a program that generates a grid and performs selective analysis based on user input.
  **Requirements**
  **Part 1: Grid Generation**
Get a number input from the user (N)
Create an NxN grid comprising of random even numbers between 2 and 20 (including those two numbers)
Display the grid in the exact format shown in step 1.
Ask the user to select a number between 2 and 20 (X)
Now redraw the grid with the above number (X) selected and highlighted in the format shown in Step 2.
Also print the number of times the given number (X) has occurred the grid (NxN)
Handle the edge cases and incorrect entries( Eg: “foo” and out-of-range entries)
The program should be able to run in a terminal and be able to get input from the user and respond to those input.
The exact output of the grid should match the outputs given below.
